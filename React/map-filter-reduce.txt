DO NOT TRY TO MEMORIZE!!!!!!   search Array.prototype.filter

with map functions you always
1) put an array in front of it
2) call a function to tell it how to map

const numbers = [2,4,6,8]

function double(){
  return x*2;
}

   1          2
numbers.map(double);

the output would be a new array that all the values double the first array

FILTER-creates a new array by keeping the items that return true

var newNumbers = numbers.filter(function(num){
  return num < 10;
});

REDUCE- accumulates a value by doing something to each item in an array

var newNumber= numbers.reducec(function(accumulator, currentNumber){
  return accumulator + currentNumber;
});

this would add 2 to 4 then 6 and so on.... pretty much totals everything up

FIND- finds the first item that matches from an array.

const newNumber = numbers.find(function (num){
  return num > 7;
});

instead of looping through the whole array it stops the first time it finds true


findIndex-- same thing except it returns the index instead of returning them value




use arrow functions when you nest a function inside another.

see lines 211 in app.js for good notes
