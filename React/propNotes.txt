----------------------------Props--------------------
react components are essentially custom html elements
just like html you might have an <input> you can add attributes such as
id, value, placeholder etc... at

it looks like <input id = "root" placeholder= "enter your name">

properties or "props" are basically the equivalent to components as
attributes are to elements

function Card(props){             Card is made up for this example
 return(
  <h2> {props.fName} {props.lName}</h2>
 );
}

ReactDOM.render(
<div>
  <Card
    fName= "Josh"
    lName= "Lambright"       component and prop
  />
  <input id= "fName" /> element and attribute
</div>

 document.getElementById("root")
);

this would dynamically add josh lambright in the h2 above

think of props as js objects

you can only add custom style to html elements. you canNOT add it to attributes
