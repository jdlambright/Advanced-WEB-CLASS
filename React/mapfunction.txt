----------------Maping Data to Components or map functions----------------------
this allows you to simplify your code its very similar to a for loop but is
shorter and more simple syntax

think to the example where we were making contact cards. Rather than hard coding
every contact into the app.js we made a separate file called contacts which
had a lot of javascript obejects and we imported it at the top.

this is where we start creating functions within functions.  look below...
we made a function called createCard.  then in the parenthesis we said
"i am going to create a card for each contact in the contacts file"
then farther below  we said ok we want to map or plug the objects from
contacts by calling the createCard function.  This allows us to have much
simple code in app.js.

it is important for mapping to have coded into the
contacts file a key to tell the map function this is a new object so it
can separate them.  thats why we added key={contact.id}

if we wanted to actually display the key we would have to use
id={contacts.id} because "key" will not be rendered by react


import React from "react";
import Card from "./Card";
import contacts from "../contacts";

function createCard(contact) {
  return (
    <Card
      key={contact.id}
      name={contact.name}
      img={contact.imgURL}
      tel={contact.phone}
      email={contact.email}
    />
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1 className="heading">My Contacts</h1>
      {contacts.map(createCard)}
