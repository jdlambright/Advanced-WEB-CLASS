Props
react components are essentially custom html elements
just like html you might have an <input> you can add attributes such as
id, value, placeholder etc... at

it looks like <input id = "root" placeholder= "enter your name">

properties or "props" are basically the equivalent to components as
attributes are to elements

function Card(props){
 return(
  <h2> {props.name}</h2>
 );
}

ReactDOM.render(
<div>
  <Card name= "Josh" /> component and prop
  <input id= "fName" /> element and attribute
</div>

 document.getElementById("root")
);

this would dynamically add josh in the h2 above
